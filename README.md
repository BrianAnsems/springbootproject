Project A - Spring Boot Calculator

Initially had trouble overcomplicating the issue, incorporating HTML web pages to display the program. 
Restarted from scratch and completed the "Hello World" example in the Spring Boot reference guide.
From there, I included a simple Adding program built out of Swing.
Currently, I have the original SpringApplication.run main method from the example commented out. I'm not sure if the method is required. The adding program seems to work without it. Will confirm.
